# CV-GEN-AI-UPDATED
THE SEAMLESS CV GENEREATION THAT WILL HELP YOU TO CREATE CV WITH GREATER EFFICIENCY.
A sleek web app powered by OpenAI and Blackbox agent tools, built with Bootstrap styling for rapid, responsive UI.

Overview
This project lets users generate personalized CVs (resumes) and dashboards with AI-powered assistance. It utilizes modern agent-based workflows so users can:

Interact with OpenAI to generate, summarize, or refine CV text dynamically.

Leverage the Blackbox (named as a transparent AI agent framework) to handle backend logic, fetch user data, and orchestrate AI interactions securely.

Enjoy a clean, responsive UI via Bootstrap, with both static and dynamic (EJS) front‑end components.

🧠 Tools & Tech Stack
OpenAI – GPT‑4 powered natural language generation for CV creation, summarization, and interactive Q&A.

Blackbox – Agent orchestration system that bridges user input, database access, and AI workflows. (Ref: use-case and architecture from the video.)

Bootstrap – Front‑end framework for responsive layouts, components, and form styling.

Express.js – Node.js server for serving EJS templates and API endpoints.

EJS – Template engine used in the views/ folder for rendering dynamic CVs, dashboards, login/register pages.

MongoDB – Backed by db.js for user data and CV storage.

dotenv – Load secret keys (OpenAI, DB connection strings) from .env.
